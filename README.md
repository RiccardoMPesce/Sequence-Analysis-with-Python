# Sequence Analysis with Python
Final project of the course [Data Analysis with Python](https://csmastersuh.github.io/data_analysis_with_python_2020/) by [mooc.fi](https://www.mooc.fi/en)
(University of Helsinki - Massive Open Online Courses).

### Description
Analysis and prediction of DNA sequences with dictionaries and Markov Chains, using Python (with the PyData stack).


The instructor provided the guidance on what to write in order to achieve a particular functionality in some module, while I implemented it,
documenting my implementation and providing a proof-of-concept by running the code. In particular, underneath every code cell, I provide two 
text cells: *Idea of solution* and *Discussion*. The former is where I describe qualitatively the approach used, while the latter is where 
I give you proof of the functionality of the program with the results which I got.
