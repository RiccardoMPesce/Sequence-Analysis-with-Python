# Sequence Analysis with Python
Final project of the course [Data Analysis with Python](https://csmastersuh.github.io/data_analysis_with_python_2020/) by [mooc.fi](https://www.mooc.fi/en)
(University of Helsinki - Massive Open Online Courses). 

### Original assignment
Visit the following [page](https://csmastersuh.github.io/data_analysis_with_python_2020/project.html#sequence-analysis) to find the original assignmet title.

### Description
Biological sequences analysis with Python and the PyData stack (Numpy, Pandas).

The instructor provided the guidance on what to write in order to achieve a particular functionality in some module, while I implemented it,
documenting my implementation and providing a proof-of-concept by running the code. In particular, underneath every code cell, I provide two 
text cells: *Idea of solution* and *Discussion*. The former is where I describe qualitatively the approach used, while the latter is where 
I give you proof of the functionality of the program with the results which I got.

### Copyright notice
All the material was created by the staff of University of Helsinki, who made it available through this course on mooc.fi. All the helpers inside 
`tmc`, all the tests and the initial skeleton were created by them. 

I only take credit for implementing the modules in the notebook, as well as filling the **Idea of solution** and **Description** after every implemented module.

With the present notice, I want to thank the staff of University of Helsinki for having provided such interesting and educational course to us through their MOOC platform.
